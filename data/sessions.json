Having little more than one another for company and the generations of tradition they had brought with them, these trailblazers would go on to transform the country they made home.

And she does her best to lead a “normal” life, spending time with her mother and sister, her beloved niece Larry… and a manifestation of the late inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla who is Grace’s closest confidante.",
