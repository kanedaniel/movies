While the men were rounded up and imprisoned in internment camps, the women were left to carry on alone in isolated pockets of community in suburbs like Carlton. Having little more than one another for company and the generations of tradition they had brought with them, these trailblazers would go on to transform the country they made home. In the wave of immigration that followed the end of World War II, Italian women were once again at the forefront of rebuilding the lives of their families. In the process, they left a lasting influence on Australian culture, permeating the realms of fashion, business, community leadership and more.",

But at the dawn of the 1990s, screens were dominated by testosterone-fueled opuses, and Hollywood studios were reluctant to entrust the steering wheel to a female duo. Seduced by the script, forwarded by his associate Mimi Polk, Ridley Scott agreed to produce the film and decided, against all odds, to direct it himself. Under the British director's watch, the two accidental outlaws, fabulously portrayed by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, flee across the vastness of the Far West on an emancipatory epic that sees them defy male oppression and reveal themselves to themselves.",
